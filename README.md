# StockIt

Crawls Yahoo Finance using YQL for historical stock quotes based on a given company name and returns a probability to the user which will give them an insight on whether the stock could go up or down the next day. The probability is calculated  based on the historical price movement of the stock given the latest percentage change at market close.

This app was developed at Yahoo Hack USA 2013 hackathon at Sunnyvale on September 28th.
